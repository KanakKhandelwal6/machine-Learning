# Linear Regression in Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression, a fundamental supervised learning algorithm, using Python. Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Numpy (`pip install numpy`)
* Pandas (`pip install pandas`)
* Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)
* Scikit-learn (`pip install scikit-learn`)

## Usage



1. Install the required libraries.



2. Run the Linear Regression script.


## Features

* Simple Linear Regression
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Data visualization with Matplotlib
* Model evaluation with R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE)
